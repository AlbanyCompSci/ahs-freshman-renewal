# AHS Freshman Renewal Debates

## Installation
The project requires [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) which can be installed along with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).
Once `npm` is installed, run `npm install` to install the dependencies into `node_modules`. To build the website for deployment run `npm run make`. To clean up build files, run `npm run clean`.
